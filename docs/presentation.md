1. Hello! We’re Look Around and we’re dealing with offline drone navigation. 

2. These days drones are very widely used in warfare. Therefore the anti drone technologies are growing ever more advanced.  

3. One of the core problems is losing track of  GPS signal, which is why the drone has to be capable of navigating offline.  

4. One way to navigate offline is using the INS - Inertial Navigation System which calculates drone position using starting point and inflight telemetry data. It is precise but immensely expensive. 

5. That’s why we’ve created Look Around. Our system compares processed onboard camera image to Copernicus data. To match the image to exact place on the map a combination of scanning and AI image comparison algorithms currently implemented in Python are being used. 

6. Combining both INS and Image Processing technology allows the drone to navigate precisely. It is achieved by mitigating a drift which is the biggest flaw of the INS. 

7. External module navigates drone using camera image and telemetry data.  New approach allows to implement cheaper INSu. It’s also crucial to provide solution based on local technology.  

8. Look Around is a perfect solution for military long range UAVs, conducting reconnaissance missions. For those who seeking reliable low cost solution.
